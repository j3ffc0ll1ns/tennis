the app will have four different roles, admin, organizer, matchmaker and player. 
the initial app admin account should be create as part of the app creation with a username of admin and a password of pass@word1.
all app users will have to create an account by providing an email, phone number, username, password, first name, last name, photo.
app admins will have full edit access to all app data and be able to assign roles.

app organizers will be able to create an event with the following attributes: a date, location, starting time, count of courts reserved, the count of matches to be played on each courts and a designated matchmaker.
organizers will be able to add the following attributes for each court in an event, : surface type (grass, clay or hard), label, court capacity (2 for singles or 4 for doubles).
After the event and courts are setup, organizers will then choose from a list of players to invite to the event. 

players will need to respond to an event invite within a given timeframe or they will be automatically marked as declining the invite. as soon as the count of players who accept the event invitation equals the total court capacity, no additional invites can be accepted.

the app matchmaker will be notified after all players have been confirmed and then be able to assign each player to a specific court for each match. the matchmaker will need to record the score of each match so the app can keep a history of every match and player.
