Here is a plan for building a web app to manage a tennis league with four distinct user roles.

### **1. Architectural Components**

The application will be structured into three main parts:

* **Frontend:** A web-based interface built with a modern JavaScript framework like React or Angular. This will provide a responsive user experience for all devices.
* **Backend:** A robust API built with a framework like Node.js with Express, Python with Django or Flask, or Ruby on Rails. This will handle all business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
* **Database:** A relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL will be used to store and manage all application data.

### **2. Database Schema**

The database will include the following tables:

* **Users:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `email` (Unique)
  * `phone_number`
  * `username` (Unique)
  * `password_hash`
  * `first_name`
  * `last_name`
  * `photo_url`
  * `role` (Enum: 'admin', 'organizer', 'matchmaker', 'player')

* **Events:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `event_date`
  * `location`
  * `start_time`
  * `court_count`
  * `matches_per_court`
  * `matchmaker_id` (Foreign Key to Users table)
  * `organizer_id` (Foreign Key to Users table)

* **Courts:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `event_id` (Foreign Key to Events table)
  * `surface_type` (Enum: 'grass', 'clay', 'hard')
  * `label`
  * `capacity` (Integer: 2 for singles, 4 for doubles)

* **Invitations:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `event_id` (Foreign Key to Events table)
  * `player_id` (Foreign Key to Users table)
  * `status` (Enum: 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined', 'expired')
  * `deadline` (Timestamp)

* **Matches:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `court_id` (Foreign Key to Courts table)
  * `match_number` (Integer)
  * `start_time`

* **Match_Players:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `match_id` (Foreign Key to Matches table)
  * `player_id` (Foreign Key to Users table)
  * `team` (Integer, for doubles)

* **Scores:**
  * `id` (Primary Key)
  * `match_id` (Foreign Key to Matches table)
  * `set_number` (Integer)
  * `player1_score` (Integer)
  * `player2_score` (Integer)

### **3. API Endpoints**

The backend API will expose the following endpoints for each role:

**Admin:**

* `POST /api/users` - Create a new user
* `GET /api/users` - Get a list of all users
* `GET /api/users/{id}` - Get a specific user's details
* `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update a user's details and role
* `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete a user
* Full access to all other endpoints

**Organizer:**

* `POST /api/events` - Create a new event
* `GET /api/events` - Get a list of events they organized
* `PUT /api/events/{id}` - Update an event's details
* `POST /api/events/{id}/courts` - Add courts to an event
* `PUT /api/courts/{id}` - Update court details
* `POST /api/events/{id}/invitations` - Send invitations to players
* `GET /api/events/{id}/invitations` - View the status of invitations

**Matchmaker:**

* `GET /api/events/{id}/confirmed-players` - Get the list of confirmed players for an event
* `POST /api/matches` - Create a new match and assign players to courts
* `POST /api/matches/{id}/score` - Record the score for a match
* `GET /api/matches/history` - View the history of all matches

**Player:**

* `GET /api/invitations` - View their event invitations
* `PUT /api/invitations/{id}` - Respond to an invitation (accept or decline)
* `GET /api/matches/schedule` - View their upcoming match schedule
* `GET /api/matches/history` - View their personal match history and scores

### **4. User Interface and Experience**

* **Initial Setup:** Upon deployment, a script will run to create the initial admin account with the username `admin` and a securely hashed password for `pass@word1`.
* **Account Creation:** All new users will register through a form capturing their email, phone number, username, password, first and last name, and a profile photo.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Admins will have a comprehensive dashboard to manage all users and their roles. They will be able to view and edit all data within the application.
* **Organizer Dashboard:** Organizers will have a dashboard to create and manage their events. This will include a simple interface for adding event details, defining courts, and sending out player invitations from a list of registered players.
* **Player Dashboard:** Players will have a personalized dashboard showing their upcoming event invitations with clear deadlines. They will also be able to view their match schedules and history.
* **Matchmaker Interface:** The matchmaker will have a dedicated interface for each event they are assigned to. This interface will display the list of confirmed players and an intuitive drag-and-drop or selection tool to assign players to specific courts for each match. They will also have a simple form to enter the scores for each completed match.

### **5. Business Logic**

* **Invitation System:** When an organizer sends out invitations, the system will set a specific timeframe for players to respond. A background job (e.g., a cron job) will run periodically to check for expired invitations and automatically mark them as 'declined'.
* **Capacity Management:** The application will track the number of players who have accepted an invitation. Once the total number of accepted players equals the combined capacity of all courts for the event, no more invitations can be accepted.
* **Notifications:** The matchmaker will receive an automated notification (e.g., via email or an in-app notification) once all player slots for an event are filled, prompting them to create the match schedule.

### **6. Match Creation and Score Tracking**

* **Match Assignment:** The matchmaker will use their interface to assign players to courts for each scheduled match of the event.
* **Score Recording:** After a match is completed, the matchmaker will enter the score for each set. This data will be stored to maintain a complete history of every match and player's performance.

### **7. Security**

* **Authentication:** User authentication will be handled using tokens (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens).
* **Authorization:** The backend will implement role-based access control to ensure that users can only access the data and perform actions appropriate for their assigned role.
* **Password Security:** All user passwords will be securely hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
* **Initial Admin Account:** The initial admin account will be created with a strong, securely hashed password as part of the application's deployment process.
